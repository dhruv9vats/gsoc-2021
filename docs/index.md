# Google Summer of Code 2021 Report

## The Project: Integrating Multitaper Periodogram into Stingray

A one-line summary of [the
project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5521109757198336)
can be stated as follows:

The project involved investigating, implementing, and integrating a
superior spectral estimation technique, called the [Multitaper
Periodogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitaper), into a software package named
[Stingray](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray), which
specializes in spectral-timing analysis of astrophysical X-ray time
series.

The Stingray project is a sub-organization of
[OpenAstronomy](https://openastronomy.org/), which, as given on its
landing page, is a collaboration between open-source astronomy and
astrophysics projects to share resources, ideas, and to improve code.

While the proposed milestones only included proof-of-concept and final
implementations of the Multitaper algorithm, a proof-of-concept
implementation of a recently showcased technique ([A. Springford et al.
(2020)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab7fa1)) which uses the Multitapering concept to improve the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram, a popular technique to obtain spectral estimates of time
series with uneven temporal sampling, was also proposed as an optional
milestone.

For exhaustive details of the project, such as motivation, improvements over other methods, references and more,
please refer the [project proposal](https://gist.github.com/dhruv9vats/fdbf193600cefdaf8c8e2f54bfd83083).

Given below is a brief summary of the Multitaper spectrum estimate:

## The Work

Not only the was Multitaper algorithm successfully implemented and
merged, the Multitaper based Lomb-Scargle periodogram, of which only a
proof-of-concept was proposed, was also fully implemented, and merged,
extending on the prior implementation.

The default brute-force way to calculate the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram runs in O(n^2) time complexity and is thus impractical for research purposes. Thus, this PR contained an O(n log(n)) implementation of the same, implemented in Stingray itself, which is presented in [Press & Rybicki (2012)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258561369_Fast_calculation_of_the_Lomb-Scargle_periodogram_using_nonequispaced_fast_Fourier_transforms). It was closed in favor of the PR above to minimize potential break points and use Astropy’s implementation instead, as Astropy was already a dependency. |

This PR was created before submitting the proposal for prototyping purposes. Final implementation uses SciPy for greater granularity and flexibility, and also to keep dependencies, thus, break points, at a minimum.               |

## The Result

This project, completed under the Google Summer of Code 2021 program,
successfully implemented, and integrated a spectral estimation technique
which hopefully proves to be a valuable tool in a time series analyst's
arsenal, accounting to is desirable noise properties.

Below is a jupyter notebook, showcasing the use of this technique:

## Beyong GSoC, logical next steps

At the time of writing, support for time series with uneven temporal sampling (Lomb-Scargle)
for the `Powerspectrum` class is being worked upon, with possible extension
to the `Crossspectrum` class.

- [ ] Add support for Lomb-Scargle periodograms/uneven time-series to `Powerspectrum`
- [ ] Add support for Lomb-Scargle periodograms/uneven time-series to `Crossspectrum`
